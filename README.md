ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Akshara Molleti! I am currently studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My interests and goals are centered around improving people's qualities of life through medically-focused solutions. I aspire to combine my passion and expertise in the medical and tech fields to increase accessibility and quality of care for others. Through my leadership experience as previous Co-President of the Indian Student Association, I have worked to bring together people all over campus while learning more about my own identity and background. My hobbies includes hip hop dance (I am part of a competitive dance team!), traveling, and watching shows from all over the world. Thanks for checking out my experience!
